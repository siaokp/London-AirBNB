LONDON AIRBNB — READER CONTEXT (WHAT NUMBERS MEAN)
========================================================================
- Price column detected: 'price'
- Neighbourhood column detected: 'neighbourhood'
- Room type column detected: 'room_type'

PRICE UNIT (WHAT THE '£' BUYS):
- Most Airbnb listing datasets store 'price' as the nightly listed price (cost for ONE NIGHT).
- In this script, we interpret 'price' as the LISTED UNIT PRICE for a stay period,
  and we label outputs as 'per-night' where that is the standard assumption.

WHAT PRICE TYPICALLY EXCLUDES (IMPORTANT):
- Cleaning fees, Airbnb service fees, taxes, deposits, discounts, and extra-guest fees
  are often stored in separate fields (or not present at all).
- So: '£X' here usually means the base listing price, NOT the final checkout total.

AVAILABILITY_365 (IF PRESENT):
- 'availability_365' usually means: number of days the listing is available
  to be booked in the next 365 days (0 = fully booked/unavailable, 365 = wide open).
  This is *not* the number of days it is occupied; it’s availability, not bookings.

REVIEWS (IF PRESENT):
- 'number_of_reviews' is typically the total count of guest reviews for the listing.
  More reviews can indicate popularity, age of listing, or both.

MINIMUM_NIGHTS (IF PRESENT):
- 'minimum_nights' is the minimum stay length required by the host.
  Even a low nightly price can imply a high minimum total cost if min nights is high.
