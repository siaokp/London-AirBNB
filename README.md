# London AirBnB — Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
![London AirBnB – Key Charts](Insights/keycharts.png)
## Project Context
This project was completed during **Week 6 (Python – Exploratory Data Analysis)** of the Data Technician Skills Bootcamp, specifically as part of the **Day 4 analytical tasks**.

The week focused on applying Python libraries to real-world datasets, structuring exploratory analysis, and communicating findings clearly through both code and written outputs.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to explore the **London AirBnB listings dataset** using Python in order to:

- Understand pricing patterns across London neighbourhoods  
- Compare listing types and their impact on price  
- Practise structured, question-led exploratory data analysis  
- Translate numerical results into clear, interpretable insights  

The task emphasised analytical thinking and clarity of communication rather than advanced modelling.

---

## Dataset Overview
The primary dataset used in this project is:

- **London_AIRBNB.xlsx**

This dataset contains information on AirBnB listings across London, including attributes such as:

- Neighbourhood / location
- Listing type (e.g. entire home, private room)
- Price
- Availability and review-related fields

The dataset was treated as a realistic example of semi-structured data commonly encountered in analysis tasks.

---

## Task Overview
The core task was to:

1. Load and inspect the dataset using **Pandas**
2. Explore distributions, groupings, and summary statistics
3. Answer a set of **defined analytical questions**
4. Support findings with clear numerical outputs
5. Ensure the analysis was reproducible and well-documented

The work was completed in a Jupyter Notebook format.

## How the Task Was Met
To meet the task requirements, I:

- Used **Pandas** for data loading, cleaning, grouping, and aggregation
- Applied **NumPy** where appropriate for numerical calculations
- Used **Matplotlib** for visual exploration where useful
- Structured the analysis around clearly stated questions
- Included comments and explanations to clarify analytical intent

Rather than presenting raw tables alone, results were expressed as readable statements to reflect how insights are typically communicated to non-technical stakeholders.

---

## Going Beyond the Core Requirements
In addition to the base task, I:

- Structured the notebook around **10 explicit analytical questions**, mirroring real-world stakeholder queries
- Ensured all insights were **numerically justified**, avoiding vague or generic statements
- Added helper formatting (e.g. currency-style outputs) to improve readability
- Organised the analysis so outputs could be easily reused in reports or presentations

This approach helped bridge the gap between technical exploration and business-facing insight.
